# Code Review Exercise (Payment Split App)

## Description

We designed this exercise to measure your understanding of HTML/CSS/React/TypeScript best-practices.

It is designed to take 1-2 hours. No need to go through everything on every lines.
The exercise asks you to review a small React app.
We provide you entirely with the code. Your task is not to write any code, just to review it.

You can leave your review as comments on specific parts of the code, open a pull-request with description. Or create an online publicly acccess docs/sheet that we can check. 

This is an open-floor excercise, there is not specific area that we want you to focus on.
Any part of the codes that you feel it can be improved, you may review.

You are not expected to run the application, or attempt to review the created design. This exercise is focused entirely on reviewing code.
